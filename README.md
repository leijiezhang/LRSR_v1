# LRSR_v1
this diffrent folders are different designs of my paper
LRSR_CV5: using 5 cross validation to get the final error rate ( the mean of 5 error rate )
LRSR_LDA: the final edition of design, using LDA algorithm, embeding the instance into k-1 dim( k means the number of class of the data)
LRSR_LPP: the final edition of design, using LPP algorithm, embeding the instance into s set of cardinities, and draw the conclusion.
